    <h1 style="caret-color: aqua;">sisen的随笔</h1>
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年伍月拾陆日</h3>
    <br>This weekend I am doing my graduation design-the hoving hummingbird. 
    <br>It is now the last  period but there is also some trouble to do.
    Yesterday  I set to do it, As time goes by, I have give up.
    So I set to do polish my paper.
    And refering others, I wrote my thanks at the end of the paper.
    Today I will going to poish the logic of the artic. 
    <h3 style="color:royalblue">That is the dairy of sisen!</h1>
    <p>2021.5.5 sunday I set to make this website!</p>
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年伍月贰拾叁日</h3>
    <br>this dairy is to tell me what to do these days.
    I have arranged so much things to do for i can not stick to one thing for a long time.
    I studied the anlayse of the basic aspect of company, including the company report报表、industry;
    besides, I studied the futures(期货). Interestingly, the driving force is the varity show(综艺节目) called "glourious(shining) you(闪闪发光的你)".
    Tomorrow is the Monday, I will set to simulate futures trading.
    Besides, I can stock, too, which is really a nice thing.
    I may have the chance to conduct hedging transcations.
    What is more, I have the plane to do some programming,including the web page design、communication software programming.
    And actually, i have did a part of them.
    And there are four things to do in the same time. This just the life  I want. Thanks me and thanks the gap year I give myself. 
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年陆月壹日</h3>
    Almost ten days has pasted, during which I did not do any graduation Project. 
    actually after 5.17 I did nothing.
    These days I worked for my blog and I create a simple blog ,then it is being submitted to github.
    So others can see my masterpiece, which could meet most(80%) of my expectations.
    Today is 6.1, and this article record the past days in order to give the future.
    The best change of mine is that I begin to accept myself, and I begin to believe myself, and i begin to develop my hobbies, and i begin to calm down to study and set to do one thing.
    I walked my own road.
    I believe when you believe yourself you are making prograss.
    Thanks for this year I give myself. 
    <br><h3>二零贰壹年七月二十三日</h3>
    24，25，26，27，there is a 
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年玖月贰拾叁日</h3>
    Today is the second day i come to the work place in the GuangHua building.
    Yesterday I have a happy day for  I have a fulling day. Did some work, ate with colleague, and talk with my senior fellow apprentice from who I know I should rely on me 
    and determine my direction quickly. ANd I saw that he has a great mastery of knowledage about cfd.
    I have thought that I should set to do some work about my future work.
    Study some basic knowledage and promote my programming skill.
    If I want to do the cfd of flapping wings, I should be hard-working.
    Hope I have a happy ending.
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年玖月贰拾捌日</h3>
    In this dairy I will think back the billiards sports.
    I always aim at the billiard, but the result always can not satisfy me.
    There is always some deviation.
    The back hand may be responsible for that.
    Besides, do not be worry about that.
