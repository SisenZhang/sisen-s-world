    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年伍月拾陆日</h3>
    <br>This weekend I am doing my graduation design-the hoving hummingbird. 
    <br>It is now the last  period but there is also some trouble to do.
    Yesterday  I set to do it, As time goes by, I have give up.
    So I set to do polish my paper.
    And refering others, I wrote my thanks at the end of the paper.

    <h3 style="color:royalblue">That is the dairy of sisen!</h1>
    <p>2021.5.5 sunday I set to make this website!</p>
    <br><h3>贰零贰壹年伍月贰拾叁日</h3>
    <br>this dairy is to tell me what to do these days.
    I have arranged so much things to do for i can not stick to one thing for a long time.
    I studied the anlayse of the basic aspect of company, including the company report报表、industry;
    besides, I studied the futures(期货). Interestingly, the driving force is the varity show(综艺节目) called "glourious(shining) you(闪闪发光的你)".
    Tomorrow is the Monday, I will set to simulate futures trading.
    Besides, I can stock, too, which is really a nice thing.
    I may have the chance to conduct hedging transcations.
    What is more, I have the plane to do some programming,including the web page design、communication software programming.
    And actually, i have did a part of them.
    And there are four things to do in the same time. This just the life  I want. Thanks me and thanks the gap year I give myself.
